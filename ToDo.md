# Widgets To Do
## Input Form
* Research form database options w/ observation app in mind 
    - ~~sqlite~~ -- If the database needs input over the network then it should be hosted on another server. SQLite is good for making a database where it can be manipulated from the same machine as the input. 
    - Google Sheet? -- Could be easiest solution
    - Postgres?
    - MySql?
* Connect form to database
    - can use SQLite here -- practice form inputs
